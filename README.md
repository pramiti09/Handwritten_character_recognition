# Handwritten_character_recognition
This repository contains a CNN model that predicts handwritten letters

In this machine learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z and a-z. This we are going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

For this purpose we are using Letters class of EMNIST Dataset (NPZ file).

For results we are predicting 30 types of letters A and B 

In future we can create a GUI for this project either using the tinkter or dataflair or can integrate it with a webpage using tensorflow.js
